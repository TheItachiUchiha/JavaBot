#What this is:

Well it's relatively simple.. A bot. For the stackexchange chat.
It can read and post messages and understands a few commands.

Currently the Bot is under development.

#How do I get it:

You can simply pull the repository on your local machine, 
import the maven project and already run it.

#What do I need:

You need: Apache Maven, Java 1.8, 
and a file named bot.properties, as well as an account at any StackExchange site, having 20 (or more) reputation

##Running the bot:

It's dead simple, you grab the repository, create a file named bot.properties
in the project root containing your configuration. 

The bot.properties must contain following property configurations:

    TRIGGER={ExampleTrigger}
    LOGIN-EMAIL={Stackexchange login email}
    PASSWORD={Stackexchange login password}

Make sure there's no excess spaces in the properties file

The next thing you want to do is run `mvn clean compile assembly:single` to pack the bot into a runnable jar.
Take the runnable wherever you want it to go, and take the bot.properties with you.

Running the bot is as simple as `java -jar javabot_0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
